		<h2>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>

			<p>
				The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing
				platform was designed mainly for ebooks like the
				<a href="https://railstutorial.org/book">
					<em>Ruby ont Rails Tutorial</em> </a
				>and
				<a href="https://learnenough.com/html"
					>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</a
				>, but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the
				novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as
				<em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectiontely
				irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.

					><em>Moby-Dick</em></a
				>
				by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
			</p>

			<blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px">
				<p>
					“<span
						style="
							font-style: normal;
							font-size: 24px;
							font-weight: bold;
							color: #ff0000;
						"
						>Call me Ishmael.</span
					>
					Some years ago–never mind how long precisely–having little or no money
					in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought
					I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It
					is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
					circulation.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
				Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion
				pages. the only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who-<em>spoiler alert!</em
				>- is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
